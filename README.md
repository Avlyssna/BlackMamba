# Black Mamba

Encrypts Git repositories while allowing for file-level changes using Scrypt and AES-CBC-256. There's not much to this repository; it does what it says on the box.

I had planned a whole setup with something like Greasemonkey to decrypt the repositories from Github's web interface: kind of like how MEGA decrypts the files using JavaScript in the browser. Unfortunately, I never got that far and I don't really need that functionality. Good luck to anyone who wants to try implementing that idea.
